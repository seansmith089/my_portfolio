          <p>HI, I’m Sean and I’m a web developer based in Sydney</p>

          <br />

          <p>
            I have over 8 years experience in the IT industry, where I worked as
            a mid level support engineer. This experience, along with a number
            of industry recognised certificates has given me a solid
            understanding of computer networking, cyber security as well as
            general computer science concepts.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            It was during this time that I began to learn about automation and
            scripting using a variety of programming languages. This initial
            interest developed in something I wanted to actively pursue, which
            started my journey into web development
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            My bachelors degree in Computer Animation has also been greatly
            beneficial, as I have been able to leverage my understanding of
            design
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Rock climbing has always been a huge passion of mine, and something
            I’ve been for over 10 years.
